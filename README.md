# Crowdfunding-ETL

The purpose of this project is to aid Independent Funding with their crowdfunding ETL (extract, transform, load) project. After an initial analysis was performed, Independent Funding wants to perform an ETL on information about backers who have contributed to live projects. A combination of Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and SQL was used in order to execute this challenge assignment.
